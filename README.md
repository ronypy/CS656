Project of CS656.


1.	At first, I tried to write the program of the problem set without the socket programming style. It gave perfect result about winner after 13 iteration. File name: assignment_3_rakibul_hasan.py

2.	Later, I tried to use socket programming paradigm. you need to choose the card to send from clients to server. then server will compare that card with each other and add the value to the client who sent highest value. Files name: client1.py, client2.py, client3.py and server1.py
